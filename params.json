Unravelling the many tools and methods available as well as platform choices can eat up a lot of time. Now that we have it, time that is, our knowledge acquired is growing fast.\r\n\r\n### Dilemma \r\nWeâ€™re having so much fun trying this and learning that, our goal seems to be at the end of the stick not completely in our control. Because, as there are so many entities involved in coding, revenue streams are harder to find. \r\n\r\n### What Came First?\r\nYears ago, we decided on Quick C instead of Quick Basic. Basic offered a quicker reward in that MS-DOS came with a BASIC interpreter so familiarity was there. All that poking and peeking, sort of put us off so we went with C. Steeper learning curve but capable of inline assembler, which is what you needed for graphics drivers.  \r\nWe didn't have a goal, just interest. A decade later when most Windows development was Delphi or Basic our C background kicked in. We got a contract writing a virtual disk driver because of the way we wrote an in house program featuring multiple documents displaying OpenGL using Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC). Never did make any money with graphics.\r\n \r\n### Desktop, Mobile or Both?\r\nWith the cloud gaining capability amazingly fast that question should remain unanswered for now, in our minds. DirectX12 or Vulkan. Learn both. Any good stuff will need to be tweaked anyhow.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
